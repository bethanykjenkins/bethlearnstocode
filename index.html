...but it wasn't really a "great" job and it was a 2 hour bus ride from the city. So I knew I needed a new job. The problem was picking one.

I studied Chemical Engineering in undergrad, so I had a background with a couple basic programming languages. I started looking into a coding career because I knew the field is growing and there are many job openings, so I did some research. I learned a few things that encouraged me to pursue the field. 

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics:
"Employment of computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow 12 percent from 2018 to 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. These occupations are projected to add about 546,200 new jobs. Demand for these workers will stem from greater emphasis on cloud computing, the collection and storage of big data, and information security.

The median annual wage for computer and information technology occupations was $86,320 in May 2018, which was higher than the median annual wage for all occupations of $38,640."

Although technology occupations offer a higher wage, there is still a gender gap; however there are several nonprofits working to encourage girls to pursue jobs in technology.

"Girls Who Code is on a mission to close the gender gap in technology and to change the image of what a programmer looks like and does

Computing is where the jobs are — and where they will be in the future, but fewer than 1 in 5 computer science graduates are women.

In 1995, 37% of computer scientists were women. Today, it’s only 24%. If we do nothing, in ten years the number of women in computing will decrease to just 22%."

Technology jobs also provide an unconventional creative outlet. As a developer I have the potential to create things that people will use everyday from scratch. It is the newest and most innovative artistic medium.

Ultimately, my hopes in pursuing a career in software engineering can be summed up as:
1. A higher paying job that provides a better quality of life.
2. I thrive in a challenging field, so I will better find fulfillment in my career.
2. Utilize my position to inspire young women to break sterotypes and pursue jobs in technology.
3. Have a job that combines my creative abilities with my scientific aptitude to potentially better human life.
